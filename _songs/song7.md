  Lullaby once - twice lullaby until we pass the Danube by
  Until we pass the Danube’s swell and beat upon the drum as well -
  That’s when - Mama - you can cry - when you see him on the fly.
  He is serving in the war - On a horse as black as tar.
  On a tar-black horse he rides with sword and rifle at his side.
