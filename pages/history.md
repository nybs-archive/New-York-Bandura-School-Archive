## Beginnings
The School was started in 1968 by Rev. Serhiy Pastukhiv as a children's ensemble. Under his leadership, the school grew to over 200 musicians. 

In 1979, Volodymyr Yurkevytch was music director. Later that same year, Julian Kytasty took on the role. 

The School (known at the time as the New York School of Bandura) had its own annual publication, "BANDURA", which ran from 1981 - 2001 and was popular within the bandura community. 

## Offshoots
The School has its own associated Ensemble, the New York Bandura Ensemble, as well as Homin Stepiv / Echo of the Steppe, a 16-member co-ed ensemble that toured extensively, particularly in the 1980s. Homin Stepiv was founded by Julian Kytasty in 1982.

## South America Lessons
Between 1987 - 1988, Ken Bloom fundraised and arranged for the school to send 200 banduras to members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Buenos Aires and Missiones Province in Argentina, as well as Curitiba and Prudentopolis in Brazil. Julian Kytasty and others brought the instruments and traveled through these communities two times for two months between these two years, teaching students bandura and choral singing as well as performing for the residents.

In some locations that he visited, Julian met with existing bandura groups, and in others he taught students the basics, and identified adept students who could continue the lessons after he left. 

Prudentopolis, a Ukrainian diasporic municipality in Paran√°, Brazil, was one such location that did not have an existing group of bandura players. The School provided 20 Chernivke-style banduras, and Julian taught morning, afternoon, and evening. In addition, over 150 interested people were instructed as a choir. A majority of the students were women, despite the bandura often being perceived as a male instument. The city at the time had been disconnected from surrounding communities due to its location in the Brazillian jungle and the lack of train access. 

## 21st Century and Revival
The School ran throughout the mid 2010s, as evidenced by grant receipts from the New York Council of the Arts through 2014.

Throughout the 2020s, bandurists Teryn Kuzma and Zoya Shepko have been working to bring back the New York School of Bandura. Today, the School offers Individual Classes, Workshops, Concerts, and Other Events.
