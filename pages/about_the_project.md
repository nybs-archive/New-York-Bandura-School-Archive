This prototype archive was created by Tasha Hutnick, current NYBS student, as the final project for the Digital Humanities course _Digital Memories: Theory and Practice_ at the CUNY Graduate Center, taught by Prof. Aránzazu Borrachero. This archive is designed to scale to add more audio records, more mementos with different formats, and more detail to the history page!

For this prototype, the following records were used, both from the collection of Julian Kytasty:
- CD recording of the 2006 Christmas Concert
- Cassette tape for one of the lessons in Prudentopolis in 1989 (restoration still in progress)

The following records are currently being processed and will be added in later updates:
- CD recording of 3 Workshops from 1985 - 1987
- CD recording of the Year End concert at Hunter College Playhouse from June 1984
- CD recording of the concert at Stuyvesant High School in 1981
- 2 Cassette tape recordings of concerts in Prudentopolis
- 2nd Lesson Tape from Prudentopolis
*All of the above recordings are from the collection of Julian Kytasty

For this project, the following software was used:
- GarageBand
- Audacity
- iMovie
- Minicomp/Wax
