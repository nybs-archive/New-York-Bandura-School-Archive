#### **Alex**
Frontend Developer/ Internal Dev-Ed Lead<br>
Alex is a software engineer in love with the world outside of (impacted by, apart from, in spite of) tech. As a Digital Humanities masters program candidate, she hopes to bring her artistic, personal, and professional worlds in closer alignment, using the tools of her trade to engage in questions that deeply resonate with her personhood.
On the Women of Bandura project team, Alex contributed as the frontend developer.
